# Coral - EdgeTPU Accelerator

Coral is more involved than the CUDA toolkit. Both keep on changing and breaking.
Coral is dependent on various Google libraries including TensorFlow and Flatbuffers.
The basic idea is the same: offload highly parallel optimised assembly kernel pipelines
to an externally attached coprocessor card to free up local CPU resources for real-time tasks.
