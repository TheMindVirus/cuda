# cpython introspection

```py
New Documentation Tools: docs.py will help you automatically import and scan
all modules for '__docs__' (providing that none of them delete anything on import)
New Syntax: <<< and >>> to optionally replace python 'def' keyword
intended for running methods on other processors attached to the system
e.g.:
@random(ise = "<<<", r = ">>>")
def X():
    nop
    print("<<<hello>>>")
```
