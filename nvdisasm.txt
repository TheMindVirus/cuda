Usage  : nvdisasm [options] <image file>

Options
=======

--base-address <value>                         (-base)    
        Specify the logical base address of the image to disassemble. This option
        is only valid when disassembling a raw instruction binary (see option '--binary'),
        and is ignored when disassembling an Elf file.
        Default value:  0x0.

--binary <SMxy>                                (-b)       
        When this option is specified, the input file is assumed to contain a raw
        instruction binary, that is, a sequence of binary instruction encodings as
        they occur in instruction memory. The value of this option must be the asserted
        architecture of the raw binary.
        Allowed values for this option:  'SM35','SM37','SM50','SM52','SM53','SM60',
        'SM61','SM62','SM70','SM72','SM75','SM80','SM86','SM87'.

--cuda-function-index <symbol index>,...       (-fun)     
        Restrict the output to the CUDA functions represented by symbols with the
        given indices. The CUDA function for a given symbol is the enclosing section.
        This only restricts executable sections; all other sections will still be
        printed.

--help                                         (-h)       
        Print this help information on this tool.

--life-range-mode                              (-lrm)     
        This option implies option --print-life-ranges, and determines how register
        live range info should be printed:
        - count         : Not at all, leaving only the # column (number of live registers)
        - wide          : Columns spaced out for readability (default)
        - narrow        : A one-character column for each register, economizing on
        table width
        Allowed values for this option:  'count','narrow','wide'.

--no-dataflow                                  (-ndf)     
        Disable dataflow analyzer after disassembly. Dataflow analysis is normally
        enabled to perform branch stack analysis and annotate all instructions that
        jump via the GPU branch stack with inferred branch target labels. However,
        it may occasionally fail when certain restrictions on the input nvelf/cubin
        are not met.

--no-vliw                                      (-novliw)  
        Conventional mode; disassemble paired instructions in normal syntax, instead
        of VLIW syntax.

--options-file <file>,...                      (-optf)    
        Include command line options from specified file.

--output-control-flow-graph                    (-cfg)     
        When specified output the control flow graph, where each node is a hyperblock,
        in a format consumable by graphviz tools (such as dot).

--output-control-flow-graph-with-basic-blocks  (-bbcfg)   
        When specified output the control flow graph, where each node is a basicblock,
        in a format consumable by graphviz tools (such as dot).

--print-code                                   (-c)       
        Only print code sections.

--print-instr-offsets-cfg                      (-poff)    
        When specified, print instruction offsets in the control flow graph. This
        should be used along with the option --output-control-flow-graph or --output-control-flow-graph-with-basic-blocks.

--print-instruction-encoding                   (-hex)     
        When specified, print the encoding bytes after each disassembled operation.

--print-life-ranges                            (-plr)     
        Print register life range information in a trailing column in the produced
        disassembly.

--print-line-info                              (-g)       
        Annotate disassembly with source line information obtained from .debug_line
        section, if present.

--print-line-info-inline                       (-gi)      
        Annotate disassembly with source line information obtained from .debug_line
        section along with function inlining info, if present.

--print-line-info-ptx                          (-gp)      
        Annotate disassembly with source line information obtained from .nv_debug_line_sass
        section, if present.

--print-raw                                    (-raw)     
        Print the disassembly without any attempt to beautify it.

--separate-functions                           (-sf)      
        Separate the code corresponding with function symbols by some new lines to
        let them stand out in the printed disassembly.

--version                                      (-V)       
        Print version information on this tool.
